        decreased every year since 2010, with 2020 (the year of coronavirus) being the first in many where we saw a notable increase. In our visualizations we found that African Americans had the highest rates of 
        unemployment in 2020. We were also able to conclude that as educational levels increased, unemployment rates dropped alongside them. Our major takeaways from this project were that despite initially thinking 
        that unemployment rates would have been increasing yearly, in the last decade they have shown to be decreasing year by year. Minorities were seen to have higher rates of unemployment in comparison to White Americans 
        and those with higher education levels had lower unemployment rates as education increased. Another takeaway was that the notable trend of white men having power in society (in positions of power and law, 
        incarcerations rates, and as talk show hosts even) followed itself out from society into the statistics and showed itself within the visualizations of our project. Our analysis allowed us to realize that 
        minorities and women had the lowest rates of employment, with minority women specifically having drastically lower rates of employment than white men, along with various other conclusions that we were able to 
        come to with the aid of our combined visualizations and analysis.
